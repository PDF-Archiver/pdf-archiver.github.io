  image_2: "/assets/avatars/user2.jpg"
  user_2: "Jörg P."
  statement_2: "Until now, all PDFs with cryptic file names were stored in a single folder. With the help of PDF Archiver I have finally been able to structure my accounting."

  image_3: "/assets/avatars/user3.jpg"
  user_3: "Tim D."
  statement_3: "By the uniform sorting of all documents I finally got order into the PDF files on my computer."

  image_4: "/assets/avatars/user4.png"
  user_4: "iFun"
  statement_4: "The Mac app uses a simple file name convention, which simply notes keywords, data and descriptions in the file name of the documents and can therefore be used largely independently of the operating system, cloud provider and Mac or PC application."
