### Summary

PDF Archiver can be used via a subscription model with constant low fees from now on!
This includes a 2-week free trial period.
This results in the following changes:

* all purchases prior to version 1.3.0 are still valid!
* a new subscription model, which includes a free trial, can be used from version 1.3.0

Some more features were added:

* Pictures (png, jpeg etc. files) in the observed folder will be converted to PDFs. The original file will be moved to trash afterwards.
* The User can decide, if he wants to remove all non-standard characters from the document filename. This option is available in the preferences.

After the update, the app requires an active Internet connection for a validation process the first time it is started. It can then also be used offline.
If problems should occur, I would be pleased about feedback: [mail@pdf-archiver.io](mailto:mail@pdf-archiver.io)
