<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your account and for restricting access to your password and to your computer while logged into the App. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your computer. We endeavor to use reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your Content or the personal information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the App or its contents. You accept all risks of unauthorized access to the User Data and any other information you provide to us.
You understand that all information, data, text, software, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials (“Content”), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, available in connection with the App are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated.

Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on the App.
You agree to not use the App to: (a) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; (b) harm minors in any way; (c) impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an PDF Archiver official, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; (d) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (e) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights of any party; (f) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation; (g) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; (h) interfere with or disrupt the App or servers or networks connected to the App, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the App; and/or (i) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law.

PDF Archiver AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO SUCH INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND CONTENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h2 id="indemnity">Indemnity</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, representatives, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise seek to make available through the App, your use of the App, your connection to the App, your violation of the Terms, or your violation of any rights of another person or entity.</p>

<h2 id="termination">Termination</h2>
<p>You agree that we may, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate your account and/or access to the App. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations of the Terms or other incorporated agreements or guidelines, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (d) discontinuance or material modification to the App (or any portion thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (f) extended periods of inactivity, and/or (g) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the App. Termination of your account may include (x) removal of access to all offerings within the App, (y) deletion of your information, files and Content associated with or inside your account, and (z) barring of further use of the App. Further, you agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in our sole discretion and that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account or access to the App.</p>

<h2 id="applicable-laws">Applicable laws</h2>
<p>This App is controlled by PDF Archiver from its offices within the United States of America. We make no representation that the Content in the App or the App are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access this App from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the Content in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations. Any action related to the App, the Content or the Terms shall be governed by New York law and controlling U.S. federal law, without regard to conflicts of laws thereof. You hereby consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Westchester County, New York for any legal proceedings related to the App or the Terms. If any party hereto brings any suit or action against another for relief, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of these Terms, the prevailing party will have and recover against the other party, in addition to all court costs and disbursements, such sum as the court may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys’ fees. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the parties agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the App or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Sections 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 shall survive termination of your account and/or the Terms.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and PDF Archiver as a result of the Terms or your use of the App. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and PDF Archiver with respect to your use of the App. The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of us. We have the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the App. Our notice to you via email, regular mail, or notices or links on the App shall constitute acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Section titles and headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>

<h2 id="claims-for-defects-warranty">Claims for defects (warranty)</h2>

<p>The app is continuously tested by the provider in order to exclude faulty behaviour.</p>

<p>The provider makes the app available in its current version. Notwithstanding claims for defects, the user has no claim to the maintenance or creation of a specific condition and/or functional scope of the app.</p>

<p>Warranty claims are excluded if users have not installed the latest version of the app and this results in functional restrictions or a lack of compatibility.</p>

<p>The provider assumes no guarantees in the legal sense with regard to the app.</p>

<h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>

<p>User claims for damages are excluded. Excluded from this are claims for damages by users arising from injury to life, limb or health or from the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) as well as liability for other damages based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by the provider, its legal representatives or vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment is necessary to achieve the objective of the contract.</p>

<p>In the event of a breach of material contractual obligations, the provider shall only be liable for foreseeable damage typical of the contract if this was caused by simple negligence, unless the user’s claims for damages are based on injury to life, limb or health.</p>

<p>The limitations of the two previous paragraphs also apply in favour of the legal representatives and vicarious agents of the provider if claims are asserted directly against them.</p>

<p>The liability of the provider under the Product Liability Act and within the scope of application of §44a TKG remains unaffected.</p>

<p>Liability for the restoration of user data is otherwise limited to the necessary costs of restoration that would have been incurred even with regular and appropriate data backup measures.</p>
