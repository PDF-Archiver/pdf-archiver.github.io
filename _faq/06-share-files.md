title: How can I share my archive folder?
---

You can share your archive folder with your friends and family by sharing it via iCloud Drive:

1. Create new folder in iCloud Drive
2. for example, in the iOS app of PDF Archiver, go to Settings > Storage > Select Folder.
3. select the shared folder in the dialog

Then the contents of the archive will be moved to the new folder.
Attention: Before you make such changes to your archive, you should create a backup first. Ideally, these should also be created regularly.
