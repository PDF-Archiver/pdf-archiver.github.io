title: iOS and macOS Subscriptions?
---

At the moment there is no possibility to share a subscribtion between iOS and macOS via the App Store. Therefore I would need external servers/databases and store user data. I don't want that and that's why you have to buy 2 subscriptions at the moment. As soon as there is another possibility here I will take a closer look. I'm sorry!
