title: How can I update the unttaged Documents?
---

Click on the Menu Bar in **PDF Archiver**: `File > Reload Documents`

This will refresh the available tags by analysing the tags in your archive. Normally, this step should not be necessary. Please consider to open an [issue]({{site.github_url}}/issues) if you have to use this workaround.
